 # Iot based location Tracker

> **Abstract** : GPS-Based Tracker for IoT: Working and Components
A GPS-based tracker in an IoT system is designed to monitor and transmit real-time location data using GPS technology and wireless communication modules. Here’s how it works:

1. Components of the Tracker
GPS Module (e.g., NEO-6M, u-blox) – Receives signals from GPS satellites to determine the device’s location.
Microcontroller (e.g., ESP32, Arduino, Raspberry Pi) – Processes GPS data and manages communication.
Wi-Fi (ESP8266, ESP32) – Uses wireless internet for communication.
LoRa (RA-02, RYLR998) – Transmits data over long distances with low power consumption.
Power Supply – A battery or power adapter to keep the device running.
Cloud Server / IoT Platform (e.g., Firebase, AWS, ThingsBoard) – Stores and processes location data.
User Interface (Mobile App or Web Dashboard) – Allows users to view real-time tracking data.
2. How It Works
Location Detection

The GPS module communicates with satellites to determine its precise latitude, longitude, altitude, and time.
This data is sent to the microcontroller for processing.
Data Processing & Transmission

The server stores and processes the data for visualization.
Data Storage & Visualization

The IoT cloud platform receives, analyzes, and stores real-time location updates.
Users can access the web or mobile app to track the device on a map interface.
